# The initial task starts in the kernel domain (assigned via
# initial_sid_contexts), but nothing ever transitions to it.
neverallow domain kernel:process { transition dyntransition };

# The kernel domain is never entered via an exec, nor should it
# ever execute a program outside the rootfs without changing to another domain.
# If you encounter an execute_no_trans denial on the kernel domain, then
# possible causes include:
# - The program is a kernel usermodehelper.  In this case, define a domain
#   for the program and domain_auto_trans() to it.
# - You failed to setcon u:r:init:s0 in your init.rc and thus your init
#   program was left in the kernel domain and is now trying to execute
#   some other program.  Fix your init.rc file.
# - You are running an exploit which switched to the init task credentials
#   and is then trying to exec a shell or other program.  You lose!
